"Fuzzy-Inference-System" 

A. The required data for this question is available in the HW01.gdb database located in the Q3 folder.

B. First, using the information available in the HW01 database, I loaded the two layers: precipitation (Precip) and the distance from the river (Dist2River) into the environment. Then, I set the Dist2River layer as the reference environment and selected one of the districts in Tehran (Districts). Using these two layers, I calculated the distances and then reviewed the scales.

C.For the two layers, I created a new variable with categorical membership. Then, display the precipitation and the distance from the river as a .tiff file format.

D. By defining the rules for the fuzzy inference system, I created an output layer for the river cell and display the river layer in .tiff format.
